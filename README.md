# Stëmm

## Introduction
### Stëmm is a chrome extension that allows you to control Google Chrome using your voice.

2. Create a new file called `config.js` and paste the following line: `globalThis.KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY>`
3. Open the extension *in developer mode* as an unpacked extension on `chrome://extensions`
